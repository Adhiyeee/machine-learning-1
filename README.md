# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on medical data using machine learning algorithms.



## Project Overview
The goal is to build a predictive model using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
We perform data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from Kaggle.

ðŸ”— [Download Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

A small sample dataset is included in the `data/` folder for demonstration.  
To run the model on the full dataset, download it from Kaggle and place it inside the `data/` folder.
